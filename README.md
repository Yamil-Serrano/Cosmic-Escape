# Meteor Dodge

## Overview

**Meteor Dodge** is an exciting space-themed game where players control a ship, dodging incoming meteors while racking up points. Built for the ESP8266 microcontroller, this game showcases the power of embedded programming and real-time graphics on a 128x64 LCD display.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Move your ship left and right using two buttons.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Avoid meteors that fall from the top of the screen and try to survive as long as possible.
- **Scoring System**: Increase your score by letting meteors pass without collision. Score resets if you hit a meteor!
- **Graphics**: Beautifully rendered graphics on a 128x64 pixel display using the U8g2 library ðŸ˜‚.

## Hardware Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following hardware:

- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**: A Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that allows for easy programming and integration with various components. But you can use any Microcontroller, just make sure you connect everything well.
- **128x64 LCD Display**: A graphical display to show the game interface.
- **Two Push Buttons**: For controlling the movement of the ship (left and right).
- **Connecting Wires**: To connect the display and buttons to the ESP8266.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Arduino IDE.
3. Make sure you have the U8g2 library installed.
4. Connect the hardware as specified in the code.
5. Upload the code to your Microcontroller.
6. Enjoy dodging meteors in space!

## How to Play
